## Scenario

## Instructions
1. Run the Angular CLI `build` command and use the `-a` option to target different apps in the workspace by name.
1. Explore the `dist` dir to see the results.
1. Run `build` again for an app with the `--prod` option flag, examine the results in the `dist` dir.
1. Run `build` for an app with `--prod` and `--build-optimizer` option flags, examine the results in the `dist` dir.
1. Run the npm script `affected:apps` and target the SHAs `1ee3a41` and `b88bc46` (remember, you can use ` -- ` to pipe additional args through to the npm script).
1. Test out the npm script `format` by making some formatting changes to an app or lib file and then running the script.
